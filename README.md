# qthrottle

Limits concurrency of promise returning functions.

## Installation

	$ npm install qthrottle

## Example

### Before

The downloader function will start as many download sessions as it is called.

	var downloader = (function() {

		return function(url) {
			// return an promise
		};

	})();

### After

The new downloader function will start as most 10 download sessions at once.

	var downloader = (function() {

		var throttle = require('qthrottle')(10);

		var download = function(url) {
			// return an promise
		};

		return function(url) {
			return throttle.fcall(download, null, url);
		};

	})();

## API

	var throttle = require('qthrottle')(limit)

* limit - concurrency limit


	var promise = throttle.fcall(func, thisArg, arg1, arg2, ...)

* promise - an [Q](https://github.com/kriskowal/q) promise which is going to be resolved once promise returned by func resolves

* func - function which is going to be limited

* thisArg - this object or null for calling the function

* arg1, arg2, ... - variable arguments list for func


	var promise = throttle.fapply(func, thisArg, args)

* promise - an [Q](https://github.com/kriskowal/q) promise which is going to be resolved once promise returned by func resolves

* func - function which is going to be limited

* thisArg - this object or null for calling the function

* args - arguments array for calling the function
